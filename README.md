# GF_QSE
Green's funciton calculation using QSE
The whole workflow exists in VQE_QSE_workflow
   - Generate the Hamiltonian
   - Calculate ground state using VQE
   - Access excited states through QSE and calculate Green's function
   - Calculate self-energy and energy

Results: Results for H4 chain and ring, contains all the self-energy and Green's function files as well.
